Agile Software Development
 Knowing/Perceiving: Students learn basic concepts and methods of agile 
software development. Based on their knowledge acquired in the Bachelor 
course project management they better understand how to adopt the 
concept of Agility in Project Management. The course addresses in 
particular the SCRUM methodology. 
Applying: The students also learn tools supporting agile project 
management. 
Analyzing/Evaluating: The course applies and reflects traditional project 
management tools in the light of agility. This contrasts the two approaches 
and highlights the differences and the applicability of agility to different 
project settings. 
Synthesizing: The course trains also the use of Agile Project Management 
tools. The students set up a project in teams and manage their fictive work. 
They are encouraged to link their project management with a project they 
complete in a different course during the same semester.

Text Mining and Search
 
 
Knowing/Perceiving: Students learn essentials in content extraction and 
information retrieval as the basis of content analysis in texts, which, in 
turn, provide the theoretical basis for the successful design of advanced 
content analysis. 
Applying: The students implement the methods they learn while using 
well-established tools for data analysis (for example, Apache Lucene), 
which are valuable for the design of search engines. 
Analyzing/Evaluating: In the teamwork of the project, the students apply 
their theoretical design knowledge in the development of specialty search 
engines. They embrace thus the design versatility in the development of 
features for text analysis and retrieval. In their practical work they can 
reflect the effectiveness and potentials of their design approaches. 
Synthesizing: The result of the course is manifested in a course-wide 
project that involves the development of a search engine with special 
search features. Application development is thereby broken down into 
smaller work packages. Each team (two or three students) assumes a 
work package, organizes its individual tasks, and contributes to the 
management of the overall project. 
The self-empowered organization of the project work also includes 
explorative learning. Students are so encouraged to learn new 
methodologies or tools on their own (with support from the professor), 
provided their individual part of the project work requires that.

eBusiness
  
 
Expertise is in terms of knowledge and understanding of business models and 
processes, provides typical eBusiness architectures and social media 
characteristics and the design of specific marketing requirements. The basic 
technical standards are considered. Methodological expertise is sought in 
particular in the process design, the implementation and realization of customer 
relationship based marketing concepts in eBusiness. 


Human-Computer Interaction
 Knowing/Perceiving: Students learn essentials in cognitive science as 
the basis of human-machine communication, which, in turn, provide the 
theoretical basis for the successful design of user interaction. They deal 
in particular with the user and task analysis. 
Applying: The theoretical knowledge guides the students in developing 
user stories that serve as blueprints for the user interaction. The course 
emphasizes the implementation of interaction in different environments 
using, for example, the description language for user interfaces in mobile 
applications (XAML etc.). It outlines in particular the role of natural 
language in interaction. 
Analyzing/Evaluating: Students develop in teams concrete user 
interfaces for different tasks. According to the task and user analysis they 
set up objectives, that are validated in the actual implementation. 
Synthesizing: The result of the course is manifested in a course-wide 
project that involves the development of an application with a high degree 
of user interaction. Application development is thereby broken down into 
smaller work packages. Each team (two or three students) assumes a 
work package, organizes its individual tasks, and contributes to the 
management of the overall project. 
The self-empowered organization of the project work also includes 
explorative learning. Students are so encouraged to learn new 
methodologies or tools on their own (with support from the professor), 
provided their individual part of the project work requires that.
